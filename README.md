# Tech Stack

Hey **GWP Team**,

I’m **JaiprakashJH**, and as you already know, we’re working on the **"Tech Stack"** project. This is a platform designed for beginner coders or anyone who wants to start learning coding for free.

Imagine if everyone had the opportunity to learn coding. The possibilities are endless, and that’s exactly what we’re working toward!

Just a quick note: **please don’t copy the code** for your own websites. Let’s keep pushing forward on this project and make it the best resource out there for new coders.

Thanks for all the hard work! Let’s keep it up!

Happy coding!
